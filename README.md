#Pixel Rendering Engine:
Pixels and all other graphics are rendered in the BluePoly Rendering Engine by Saois Technologies

#Intended Uses:
Primary 3D game engine for DuoCore Studios

#FAQ:
  Q: Will You add any other Developers in the future
  A: We do intend to add other developers to the project
  
  Q: What stage is the engine at
  A: The engine is at a very, VERY prealpha stage. So far, we have been able to render a low quality, 3D forever extending terrain, but I cannot remember if this function will be opened up to GitHub in this release or the next one
  
  Q: How difficult is it to develop games in Nengine
  A: Unlike simplified game engine for beginners such as GameMaker, Unity3D, our former PulseEngine, Unreal, Crysis, or the like, Nengine requires that its code be modified to fit the texture map desired by the developer. Which means that anyone who wishes to design a game with this engine must make it open source, and their texture maps freely available, however, developers can charge a fee for using their texturemaps.
  
  Q: When developing the texture map system, what did your default TextureMap look like
  A: [![texturemap](https://github.com/Saois-Technologies/Negativity-Engine/raw/master/img/texturemap.jpg)]
     I made the textures back in 2007 and repurposed them for this. I love our little villain character!
